    """Serves as an entry point for controller Kubernetes events.

    `ControllerPipeline` is an entry point handler for the Kuryr-Kubernetes
    controller. `ControllerPipeline` allows registering
    :class:`kuryr_kubernetes.handlers.k8s_base.ResourceEventHandler`s and
    ensures the proper handler is called for each event that is passed to the
    `ControllerPipeline`. Also it ensures the following behavior:

      - multiple `ResourceEventHandler`s can be registered for the same
        resource type (`OBJECT_KIND`)

      - failing handlers (i.e. ones that raise `Exception`s) are retried
        until either the handler succeeds or a finite amount of time passes,
        in which case the most recent exception is logged

      - in case there are multiple handlers registered for the same resource
        type, all such handlers are considered independent (i.e. if one
        handler fails, other handlers will still be called regardless; and the
        order in which such handlers are called is not determined)

      - events for different Kubernetes objects can be handled concurrently

      - events for the same Kubernetes object are handled sequentially in
        the order of arrival
